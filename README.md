## Cogs
Cogs are separated into sub-directories to allow for features to be more organised

### Events
This cog sub-directory will be used for discord events such as "on_member_join" or "on_message_delete"

### Utils
The utils directory is used to save time when rewriting the same code repeatedly. It currently has:

#### logs.py
For logging actions to either paste.gg or the logs channel specified on config.py

#### responses.py
For responding to a command with either a success or error without recreating the same embed design repeatedly

#### rank_card.py
For generating a nice looking rank card for a user.
